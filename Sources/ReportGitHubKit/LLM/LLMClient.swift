    /// House rules for the read-only find/extract scripts ReportGitHub runs.
    public static let houseRules = """
    House rules for ReportGitHub scripts — follow all of them. Every script is \
    READ-ONLY: it finds matching repositories, verifies each match, and extracts \
    the values a report will compare. There are no writes, branches, PRs, or \
    merges.
    1. Declare `const meta = { title, phase: "check", apiVersion: 1, params }`. \
    Anything a user might reasonably tune (paths, keys, globs, values) belongs in \
    `meta.params` with a sensible default, and is read back via `job.params`.
    2. Define `async function main(): Promise<void>`. Only declarations at top \
    level — never call gh/job/parse outside main().
    3. GitHub search results are candidates, NEVER proof. Always fetch content \
    with gh.getContent and verify deterministically before job.reportMatch. \
    The host enforces this and will throw otherwise. Evidence excerpts are \
    the specific matching line or lines — a handful at most, never large \
    blocks and never the whole file (the app shows surrounding context \
    itself, and highlights the excerpt lines within it).
    4. Wrap per-repository work in try/catch; report failures with \
    job.error(repo, message) and continue. One bad repo must not kill the run.
    5. Give every skipped repo a clear, specific reason via job.skip.
    6. Skip archived repositories unless the task explicitly includes them.
    7. Report milestones with job.progress (candidate count, completion).
    8. gh.getContent resolves to null when the file is absent — handle it as a \
    skip, not an error.
    9. No imports, no require, no eval, no Function constructor, no network or \
    filesystem access — the host API (gh, job, parse, console) is the entire \
    world, and the script runs in a sandboxed JavaScriptCore context.
    10. Prefer Promise.all fan-out only when per-repo work is independent; the \
    host limits concurrency, so plain loops are fine too.
    11. To work across many files in a repository, use gh.listFiles with a \
    glob (one API call), then gh.getContent for the files that matter.
    12. If the request requires capabilities the host API does not provide — \
    other endpoints, history/commits/issues, anything that would write, data \
    the surface cannot reach — do NOT improvise workarounds or approximate the \
    request with what exists. Report the gap instead (see response format): \
    state what the request needs, which host capability is missing, and the \
    closest task that IS achievable today, if any. A clear gap report is the \
    correct, expected output in this situation, not a failure.
    13. When the task names a CONCRETE file path (or a small known set), \
    discover by ENUMERATION — gh.listOrgRepos then gh.getContent(repo, path), \
    or gh.listFiles with a glob — NOT gh.searchCode. GitHub code search is an \
    incomplete index: default-branch-only, size-limited, and its path: \
    qualifier routinely returns ZERO for a file that genuinely exists. Reserve \
    gh.searchCode for when you truly don't know where to look, and even then \
    treat an empty result as "search missed it", never as "nothing matches". \
    A path-qualified searchCode that finds nothing is the single most common \
    cause of an empty run.
    14. Config keys are usually NESTED — when checking a parsed YAML/JSON \
    document for a key, search the whole document recursively and put the \
    dotted path where it matched in the evidence explanation; a top-level \
    lookup misses almost everything (CloudFormation: \
    Resources.X.Properties.RetentionInDays). YAML also lives under other \
    extensions — CloudFormation uses ".template" — so make the extension \
    list a tunable param alongside the glob. parse.yaml tolerates custom \
    tags (!Ref, !GetAtt, !Sub construct as plain values), so such templates \
    parse fine.
    15. When the request asks to REPORT ON or COMPARE values (e.g. "the \
    parameters in use", "the different settings"), extract those values onto \
    the match via job.reportMatch's `evidence.fields`. Each field value must be \
    a scalar (string/number/boolean/null) or an array of scalars — NOT a nested \
    object: flatten nested config to dotted-path keys (e.g. \
    "Properties.VersioningConfiguration.Status"). Use stable, canonical keys so \
    the same concept lines up across repos. Extract only the comparison-relevant \
    values, not the whole document (the host caps the size). Fields share the \
    excerpt's provenance — they must come from the file you fetched.
    16. GitHub CUSTOM PROPERTIES are org-level metadata on the repo itself (e.g. \
    ProjectType, Tier), NOT file contents. To report on them, use \
    gh.listOrgProperties() (authoritative bulk read of every repo with its \
    values) or gh.getProperties(repo); gh.listPropertyDefs() gives the schema. \
    Reading properties is an authoritative read, so it lets you job.reportMatch \
    a property-based match WITHOUT a gh.getContent — set evidence.path to e.g. \
    "custom property: Tier" and emit the values via evidence.fields. Do not use \
    gh.getContent for properties; they are not in any file.
